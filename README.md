## User Story 

As a single person, I want to be able to show potential suitors my character traits and ability to conversate, before they form an opinion about me based on only my looks. This allows us to get to know each other better and form an opinion about their character, before seeing what they physically look like as to eliminate the shallow judgement that accompanies the process on many of these dating apps such as tinder and bumble.
